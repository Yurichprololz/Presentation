					<section>WHAT IS OPEN SOURCE?</section>
					<section>
					<span>
						Open Source is a broad software license that makes 
						source code available to the general public with relaxed
						 or non-existent restrictions on the use and modification of the code.
					</span>	</section>

				<section class="2">
					<section>WHAT IS OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE?</section>
					<section>Open Source software is computer software that 
						is released under a license in which the copyright 
						holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, 
						and distribute the software and its source code to anyone
						 and for any purpose.</section>
				</section>
				<section class="3" >
					<section><h6>History of creation </h6></section>
					<section>The concept of free sharing of technological information existed long before computers. Similar to open standards, researchers with access to Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) used a process called Request for Comments to develop telecommunication network protocols which led to the birth of the INTERNET in 1969. The term Open Source was adopted by a group of people held at Palo Alto, California. "Open Source Summit" organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly.</section>

          <section> <h6>The criteria for open-source software</h6>
          </section>
          <section> <h6>Free Redistribution</h6> <span>The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources </span> </section>
          <section><h6>Source Code</h6> <span>The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. </span></section>
          <section><h6>Derived Works</h6> <span>The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software</span></section>
          <section><h6>Integrity of The Author's Source Code</h6> <span>The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. </span></section>
          <section><h6>No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</h6> <span>The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons </span></section>
          <section><h6>No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</h6> <span>The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. </span></section>
          <section><h6>Distribution of License</h6> <span>The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties</span></section>
          <section><h6>License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</h6> <span>The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution</span></section>
          <section><h6>License Must Not Restrict Other Software</h6> <span>The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software</span></section>
          <section><h6>License Must Be Technology-Neutral</h6> <span>No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.</span></section>

			<h6>Conclusion</h6>
		</section>
	<section>
		Common platform for sharing ideas and putting them into action by developers or other people who wish to improve a software. I think Open Source is a really good thing and I recommend to use it but you should be careful because it has some disadvantages and one of them is possible problems with law.
